  - The doll is broken.
  - Head's been torn off. 
  - You're sure this is a sign of something.
  - This was not just a storm, not just clouds and wind, 
  - it was people crashing down, causing harm.
  -  A calamity, more like.
  - You should get angry about this.
  - It's been done to YOU.
  - This is injustice, 
  - and little you never had a chance of doing anything about it.
  - (Voices)
  - No doll anymore.
  - But these are not the only things you had.
  - You had places to play. Places to enjoy.
  - There's a sandbox... You can't destroy sand. 
  - They could not have taken THAT from you.
  - Find the sandbox... Find a way to reason with yourself.
  - Maybe you can make this look better.
