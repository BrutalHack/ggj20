  - It's bad.
  - CMD:Sun
  - You can barely see yourself,
  - or rather, what you imagined yourself to be in this place.
  - The water is cloudy.
  - You're hidden, and more than a little lost.
  - That puddle is a remnant of the storm that passed over the playground.
  - It's no use denying it...
  - The clear waters were disturbed. You can no longer see yourself.
  - Someone did this to you.
  - You've been betrayed.
  - (Voices)
  - See what you can save, little one.
  - You had a doll, didn't you? Dolls are good.
  - Find it... Let it calm you down
