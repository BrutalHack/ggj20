  - And now... you've found your place.
  - You can see the whole playground from here.
  - What you conjured from your imagination,
  -  and what it turned out to be, in the end.
  - There's a dark, little feeling, worming its way up your spine. 
  - Take a deep breath and think about it.
  - You're alone.
  - You are powerless, and not even your dreams will be safe.
  - (Voices)
  - As I said...
  - No use dwelling on particulars.
  - You do know this will happen again, again and again. 
  - Why rebuild? Why keep favorite dolls around?
  - You might think being sad won't help you at all...
  - (Voices)
