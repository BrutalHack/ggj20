  - There has been a terrible storm.
  - It's no use to dwell on... particulars. 
  - You were drifting along, like the little lost leaf that you are, 
  - and then suddenly you weren't. 
  - There was a storm. Sudden, violent, thrashing about. 
  - And then, the playground was no more.
  - CMD:BLENDIN
  - There have been people who helped you build this place...
  - (Voices)
  - But they won't help you now.
  - Because you have a terrible suspicion,
  - sneaking up on you with so many little clicking legs.
  - There's a centipede of a fear crawling up your back...
  - All those people, they made that storm.
  - As I said. No use to dwell on particulars.
  - Put this place together, little one. Put yourself together.
