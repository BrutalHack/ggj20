  texts:
  - You sit down in the sandbox.
  - Perhaps sitting is too generous a term.
  - 
  - you fall down, and are graciously stopped by wet, squishy sand.
  - It's a place for creativity.
  - Here is where you can make everything whole again,
  - grain by grain, all on your own.
  - Perhaps you can make it whole again...
  - Right?
