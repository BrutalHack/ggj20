  - You sit down in the sandbox.
  - Perhaps sitting is too generous a term. 
  - Rather: 
  - you fall down, and are graciously stopped by wet, squishy sand.
  - It's a place for creativity.
  - Here is where you can make everything whole again,
  - grain by grain, all on your own.
  - Perhaps you can make it whole again...
  - Right?
  -	(Voices)
  - Maybe you should sit down somewhere that hasn't been turned into sludge.
  - You've tried so many things...
  - Try sitting down. Think those thoughts.
